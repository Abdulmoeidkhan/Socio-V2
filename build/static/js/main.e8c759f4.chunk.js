With an estimated population of 2 million, Gilgit-Baltistan\u2019s legal identity and constitutional status has been disputed ever since the Indo-Pakistani partition in 1947. The area is currently under the occupation of Pakistan, in violation of the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) resolution of 28 April 1949. The occupation took place without the consent of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan and, despite the UNCIP\u2019s calls for Pakistan to withdraw its forces from the disputed area, the occupation remains to this day. For over 60 years now, the area of Gilgit- Baltistan is lacking a proper constitutional status, a working legal system and political autonomy. The critical shortage of a democratic setup in the region has led to constant human rights violations, extreme poverty, low literacy rates, slow economic development and growing sectarian turbulence. While Islamabad earns billions in revenue from Gilgit-Baltistan annually from trade and transit, water resource exploitation, trophy hunting, eco-tourism, mineral exploration and direct and indirect federal taxes, most of these earnings are not allocated for the development of the region. Moreover, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) cuts through the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan, forcing the local population to accept the terms and conditions of the development project without consultation nor compensation. Deprived of accountable governance structures, as well as of constitutional and human rights, more than two million people in the region wait for their fate to be resolved. Declared a disputed territory by the UNSC in 1948, the United Nations has the responsibility to fulfil the fundamental rights of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan. The international community, in turn, must remind Islamabad that it is an occupier in Gilgit-Baltistan."),r.a.createElement("h2",{className:"terr-second-heading-class","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-right","data-aos-delay":"100"}," Current Issues :-"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"pakistanBoldPara","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-left","data-aos-delay":"100"},"A confluence of many different cultures and languages, especially those related to Tibet, Central Asia and India, Gilgit-Baltistan today faces what some experts call a \"cultural genocide\". Pakistan's educational policy bans mother tongue learning as a strategy to promote cultural assimilation and to erode indigenous identities. Plans to implement Mandarin as an optional language in schools of Gilgit-Baltistan have further raised concerns over the linguistic heritage of the region. Pakistan-occupied Gilgit-Baltistan has also suffered from sectarian conflicts fuelled by Pakistan's policies since 1947. The first major sectarian clash in Gilgit-Baltistan occurred when anti-Shia riots broke out in May 1988 over the sighting of the Ramadan moon. In 2012, sectarian violence resurged, triggered by a quick succession of well-organised killings targeting Shia travellers on the three routes that connect Gilgit-Baltistan with Islamabad, killing more than sixty innocent people. Besides, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), intended to connect Western China to the Indian Ocean via Pakistan, cuts through the territory of Gilgit-Baltistan and is directly affecting more than 400,000 indigenous people and at least 200 square kilometres of natural environment and cultural heritage sites. The implementation of the project is being violently enforced against the will of the local population, who view the CPEC as a threat to their culture and natural resources. Beyond the CPEC, Pakistan plans to build five mega dams in the disputed area, in violation of the resolutions adopted by the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP). Altered stream flow and nutrient contents, for example, are expected to cause changes in the habitat, resulting in other downstream effects on water supply and fisheries. The people of Gilgit-Baltistan firmly believe that Pakistan has no right to build a dam in an area which is disputed and whose fate is still to be settled under the UNCIP resolutions. Finally, for over six decades now, Gilgit-Baltistan has seen systematic human rights violations occurring on its soil. Its people continue to live in a constitutional limbo, where the Pakistani government does not include the region in its constitution but doesn't give its people their right to self-determination or political representation either.

By the terms agreed to by India and Pakistan for the partition of the Indian subcontinent, the rulers of princely states were given the right to opt for either Pakistan or India or with certain reservations to remain independent. Hari Singh, the maharaja of Kashmir, initially believed that by delaying his decision he could maintain the independence of Kashmir, but, caught up in a train of events that included a revolution among his Muslim subjects along the western borders of the state and the intervention of Pashtun tribesmen, he signed an Instrument of Accession to the Indian union in October 1947. This was the signal for intervention both by Pakistan, which considered the state to be a natural extension of Pakistan, and by India, which intended to confirm the act of accession. Localized warfare continued during 1948 and ended, through the intercession of the United Nations, in a cease-fire that took effect in January 1949. In July of that year, India and Pakistan defined a cease-fire line the line of control that divided the administration of the territory. Regarded at the time as a temporary expedient, the partition along that line still exists. Many proposals were subsequently made to end the dispute over Kashmir, but tensions mounted between the two countries following the Chinese incursion into Ladakh in 1962, and warfare broke out between India and Pakistan in 1965. A cease-fire was established in September, followed by an agreement signed by the two sides at Tashkent (Uzbekistan) in early January 1966, in which they resolved to try to end the dispute by peaceful means. Fighting again flared up between the two in 1971 as part of the India-Pakistan war that resulted in the creation of Bangladesh. An accord signed in the Indian city of Shimla in 1972 expressed the hope that henceforth the countries in the region would be able to live in peace with each other. It was widely believed that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, then prime minister of Pakistan, might have tacitly accepted the line of control as the de facto border, although he later denied this. After Bhutto was arrested in 1977 and executed in 1979, the Kashmir issue once again became the leading cause of conflict between India and Pakistan. Several movements have variously sought a merger of Kashmir with Pakistan, independence for the region from both India and Pakistan, or the granting of Indian union territory status to Buddhist Ladakh. To contend with these movements, confront Pakistani forces along the cease-fire line, and support the administrative structure of Jammu and Kashmir state, the Indian union government has maintained a strong military presence there, especially since the end of the 1980s."),r.a.createElement("h2",{className:"terr-second-heading-class","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-right","data-aos-delay":"100"}," Area :-"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"pakistanBoldPara","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-left","data-aos-delay":"100"},"85,800 square miles (222,236 square km)"),r.a.createElement("h2",{className:"terr-second-heading-class","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-right","data-aos-delay":"100"}," Provincial Capital :-"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"pakistanBoldPara","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-left","data-aos-delay":"100"},"Muzaffarabad."),r.a.createElement("h2",{className:"terr-second-heading-class","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-right","data-aos-delay":"100"}," Population :-"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"pakistanBoldPara","data-aos-duration":"1500","data-aos":"fade-left","data-aos-delay":"100"},"(2011est.) 12.5 million.")))),r.a.createElement(Z,null))},tt=(t(476),p.a.Content),nt=function(e){var a=Object(w.g)();return r.a.createElement(p.a,null,r.a.createElement(q,null),r.a.createElement(tt,{className:"content-container-class area-of-working-class"},r.a.createElement("section",{className:"one-columns-grid"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"center-class"},r.a.createElement("div",{className:"spacing-class"}),r.a.createElement("h2",{className:"content-head"},"Area Of Working"),r.a.createElement("p",{className:"content-para"},"Social work itself is a diversified field that aims to aid individuals, groups and communities in all domains of life.
